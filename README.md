# Popup View 🎉
> Any view, from any dashboard as a popup

Hey everyone! 👋

I've been working on a custom component that lets you open any Home Assistant view as a popup overlay. Super useful for quick access to different dashboards without leaving your current view. This is something I have been wanting in Home Assistant for a while.

It works as a service call and this means you don't need declutter cards, or populate your dashboard with a bunch of hidden popup cards that muddies your view when in edit mode.

## What it does
Opens any view from any dashboard in a sliding popup that comes up from the bottom. The popup automatically adjusts its width based on content and height to fit what's inside. Works great on both mobile and desktop!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]

## Service options
Since this runs as a service, this opens a lot of possibilities triggering and automations.

## Use Cases

### My Use Case
I now have a dedicated single view lovelace per kind of device. A mobile overview, and a wall tablet overview. Then I have all my "utility" popups that I might want to show on many devices, placed in a dedicated dashboard.

Security dashboard is nice to be able to open as a popup on all of these devices for instance.

### More use cases

#### 🏠 Room controls
Create dedicated room views with all lights, media players, and climate controls - then pop them up from anywhere. No need to duplicate cards across dashboards!

#### 🔐 Security panel
Have a security overview that pops up automatically when you arrive home (using automations). Check cameras, locks, and alarm status in one quick view.

#### 🎵 Media controls
Full media dashboard that's accessible from any room view. Great for whole-home audio control without cluttering your main dashboards.

#### 🛒 Shopping list
Pop up your shopping list from the kitchen dashboard when cooking. Add items without navigating away.

#### 📅 Calendar/agenda
Quick calendar view from any dashboard - great for checking schedules before leaving the house.

#### 🎨 Scene selector
A popup with all your scenes for different times of day. One tap from anywhere to set the mood.

#### 🚗 Garage/car status
Quick popup to check if garage is closed, car is locked, or charging status - right from your bedroom at night.

#### ☀️ Morning briefing
Automation that pops up weather, calendar, and commute info when motion detected in kitchen between 6-9am.

The beauty is you can keep your main dashboards clean and minimal, while having detailed views just a tap away!

Also works great with conditional cards - show different popups based on who's home, time of day, or device type.
