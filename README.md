# Popup View 🎉
> Any view, from any dashboard as a popup

Hey everyone! 👋

I've been working on a custom component that lets you open any Home Assistant view as a popup overlay. Super useful for quick access to different dashboards without leaving your current view. This is something I have been wanting in Home Assistant for a while.

It works as a service call and this means you don't need declutter cards, or populate your dashboard with a bunch of hidden popup cards that muddies your view when in edit mode.

<h3>What it does</h3>
Opens any view from any dashboard in a sliding popup that comes up from the bottom. The popup automatically adjusts its width based on content and height to fit what's inside. Works great on both mobile and desktop!

<h3>Example Use Cases</h3>

<br>

<h3>My Use Case</h3>

I now have a dedicated single view lovelace per kind of device. A mobile overview, and a wall tablet overview. Then I have all my "utility" popups that I might want to show on many devices, placed in a dedicated dashboard.

Security dashboard is nice to be able to open as a popup on all of these devices for instance.

<h3>More use cases</h3>

<h3>🏠 Room controls</h3>
Create dedicated room views with all lights, media players, and climate controls - then pop them up from anywhere. No need to duplicate cards across dashboards!

<h3>🔐 Security panel</h3>
Have a security overview that pops up automatically when you arrive home (using automations). Check cameras, locks, and alarm status in one quick view.

<h3>🎵 Media controls</h3>
Full media dashboard that's accessible from any room view. Great for whole-home audio control without cluttering your main dashboards.

<h3>🛒 Shopping list</h3>
Pop up your shopping list from the kitchen dashboard when cooking. Add items without navigating away.

<h3>📅 Calendar/agenda</h3>
Quick calendar view from any dashboard - great for checking schedules before leaving the house.

<h3>🎨 Scene selector</h3>
A popup with all your scenes for different times of day. One tap from anywhere to set the mood.

<h3>🚗 Garage/car status</h3>
Quick popup to check if garage is closed, car is locked, or charging status - right from your bedroom at night.

<h3>☀️ Morning briefing</h3>
Automation that pops up weather, calendar, and commute info when motion detected in kitchen between 6-9am.

The beauty is you can keep your main dashboards clean and minimal, while having detailed views just a tap away!

Also works great with conditional cards - show different popups based on who's home, time of day, or device type.
